Components are one of the most powerful features of VuePress.

They help to extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code.

At a high level, Components are custom elements that VuePress would attach specified behavior to.


## Contributing

We would love to add more components!
If you wrote a component and want to add it, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ocular-d/components/issues)!
## Credits

We found most of the components by searching the internet all credits belong to the awesome people

We'll start adding the source of the component and the original authors component by component.
